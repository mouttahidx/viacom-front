Its goal is to improve the positioning of a site on search engines. To do this, it optimizes its content and structure. This way it provides long-lasting performance. However, it should be noted that this process takes some time to produce results. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Google Ads, which is part of paid advertising strategies, ensures an immediate presence on Google search results pages, but at a cost. Although its impact can be rapid, the performance of this method directly depends on the budget invested.",
